- The woman who has no imagination has no wings** - Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter. - `1-strdup.c`.
- He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life** - Write a function that concatenates two strings. - `2-str_concat.c`.
- If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize** -Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers. - `3-alloc_grid.c`.
- It's not bragging if you can back it up** - Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your `alloc_grid` function. - `4-free_grid.c`.
- It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe** - Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program. - `100-argstostr.c`.
