## Project Description
Learn about function pointers and how to use them, what exactly they hold and point to in the virtual memory.

- What's my name** - Write a function that prints a name. - `0-print_name.c`.
- If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done** - Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array. - `1-array_iterator.c`.
- To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities** - Write a function that searches for an integer. - `2-int_index.c`.
- A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at** - Write a program that performs simple operations. - `3-main.c`, `3-op_functions.c`, `3-get_op_func.c`, `3-calc.h`.
