## Project description
Recursion in C. A function that calls itself where it is defined.
```
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}

- She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget** - Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line. - `0-puts_recursion.c`.
- Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together** - Write a function that prints a string in reverse. - `1-print_rev_recursion.c`.
- Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange** - Write a function that returns the length of a string. - `2-strlen_recursion.c`.
- You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling** - Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring. - `3-factorial.c`.
- Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate** - Write a function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`. - `4-pow_recursion.c`.
- Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer** - Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number. - `5-sqrt_recursion.c`.
- Inception. Is it possible?** - Write a function that returns `1` if the input integer is a `prime number`, otherwise return `0`. - `6-is_prime_number.c`.
- They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything** - Write a function that returns `1` if a string is a palindrome and `0` if not. - `100-is_palindrome.c`.
- Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...** - Write a function that compares two strings and returns `1` if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return `0`. - `101-wildcmp.c`.
