## Project description
What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
Basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm.
```
A library is a file containing several object files, that can be used as a single entity in a linking phase of a program.
In C there are two type of libraries: Static libraries and Shared libraries (dynamic).

## Tasks
- A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life.Create the static library libmy.a
- Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future. Create a script called `create_static_lib.sh` that creates a static library called liball.a from all the `.c` files that are in the current directory.
